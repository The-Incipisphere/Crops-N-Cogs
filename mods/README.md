# To those who are concerned by the two jar files here:

The coremod for this modpack (`cropsncogscore`) will remain here for the time being. It will hopefully be removed when the modpack reaches a stable enough state for release on CurseForge. At that point, the coremod will also be released on CurseForge.

Additionally, **Greate** is included here, as the mod is not yet available on CurseForge. I have received permission from Electrolyte, the main developer of Greate, to include the mod's `.jar` file directly in this repository.
